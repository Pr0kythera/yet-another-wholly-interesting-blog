      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;background&#34;&gt;Background&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This year, 2026 to alleviate any doubt, and this year i&amp;rsquo;ve set myself the ambition to focus on tangibly improving at Machine Learning and Reverse Engineering. Both are topics i&amp;rsquo;ve studied in my career and during my university degree. But with neither I feel like I have as much knowledge of as I would like, whilst also happening to be fascinating fields of study.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately with anything unless you&amp;rsquo;re constantly exercising with an aim to improve and deepen your abilities at best you stagnate, at worst the knowledge slowly starts fading away. So how can I achieve this and where can I start?&lt;/p&gt;</description>
